    <h3>Career Goals</h3>
    <p>My career goal is to build a future in cybersecurity where I can combine my technical skills with my interest in digital investigations and crime prevention. As an Information Communication Technology major, I want to work in a role that focuses on protecting digital systems, analyzing online threats, and investigating cybercrime, particularly within social media or large organizations.</p>

  <h3>Projects as a Learning Process</h3>

  <p>
    I view projects as a way to practice thinking, not just building. Each project helps me understand how small decisions—such as naming headings or choosing semantic elements—affect the overall clarity of a page. This site itself is one of those projects.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many of my projects involve writing instructions, creating structured content, or organizing information for an audience. I enjoy breaking down tasks into steps and making sure the final result is easy to follow. These skills are especially important in technical and professional environments.
  </p>

  <p>
    As I continue developing this site, I plan to expand this section with more detailed project descriptions. I want to include not only what I built, but what I learned, what challenged me, and how I improved. That reflection is just as important as the finished product.
