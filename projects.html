    <h3>Career Goals</h3>
    <p>My career goal is to build a future in cybersecurity where I can combine my technical skills with my interest in digital investigations and crime prevention. As an Information Communication Technology major, I want to work in a role that focuses on protecting digital systems, analyzing online threats, and investigating cybercrime, particularly within social media or large organizations.</p>

  <h3>Projects as a Learning Process</h3>

  <p>
    I see projects as a way to practice thinking, not just building things. Every project teaches me how small choices, like naming headings or picking semantic elements, can change how clear a page is overall.  </p>

  <p>
    A lot of the work I do involves writing instructions, making structured content, or putting information in order for an audience. I like breaking things down into steps and making sure the end result is easy to understand. These skills are very important in professional and technical settings.  </p>

  <p>
    As I keep working on this site, I plan to add more detailed project descriptions to this part. I want to include not only what I made, but also what I learned, what was hard for me, and how I got better. That thought is just as important as the end result.  </p>
