  <h3>How I Approach My Work</h3>

  <p>
    When I work on technical projects, I like to pay close attention to the details, especially when the instructions are clear. I like knowing why each requirement is there because it helps me stay away from shortcuts that could cause problems later. This way of thinking has changed how I learn HTML and how I organize my work.  </p>
  <p>
    I am majoring in ICT, and my interests are in technology, communication, and management. I like making things that work and are easy to understand, even if they don't look perfect yet. For me, structure is more important than design, and I can always go back to make it look pretty. A page should still make sense even if it doesn't have any color or layout changes. </p>
  <p>
    Besides my classes, I am involved in campus greek organzations (my sorority, Delta Gamma) and leadership roles in this organization, which have helped me get better at planning, talking to people, and managing projects with real deadlines. Those experiences also affect how I do technical work, especially when I think about users and audiences.  </p>
