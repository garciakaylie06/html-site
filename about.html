  <h3>How I Approach My Work</h3>

  <p>
    I tend to be very detail-oriented when I work on technical projects, especially when the instructions are specific. I like understanding the “why” behind each requirement because it helps me avoid shortcuts that can cause problems later. This mindset has shaped how I learn HTML and how I structure my work.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am an ICT major with interests that sit at the intersection of technology, communication, and organization. I enjoy building things that are clear and functional, even if they are not visually styled yet. For me, strong structure comes before design, because a page should make sense even without color or layout enhancements.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside of coursework, I am involved in campus organizations and leadership roles, which has strengthened my ability to plan, communicate, and manage projects with real deadlines. Those experiences influence how I approach technical work as well, especially when thinking about users and audiences.
