  <!-- Career Connection -->

    <h2>How I Want to Use This With My Career</h2>
    <p>
      Creating infographics allows me to combine creativity with communication, which is a skill I want
      to highlight in my future career. These designs show my ability to present information clearly,
      think visually, and tailor content to an audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      I plan to use examples like these to demonstrate to employers that I can contribute creatively
      while still meeting professional and technical expectations in digital and media-focused roles.

  <h3>Why Infographics Matter to Me</h3>

  <p>
    I am drawn to infographics because they combine organization, communication, and design into one deliverable. A good infographic does more than look appealing; it guides the reader through information in a way that feels logical and approachable. That same idea applies to how I structure web pages.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I create infographics, I focus on hierarchy and clarity. I think about what someone should notice first, what needs explanation, and what can be simplified. This mirrors how semantic HTML works, where headings and sections help users understand content even before styling is applied.
  </p>

  <p>
    Creating infographics has also helped me understand the importance of accessibility and audience awareness. If information is confusing or overwhelming, the design has failed. That lesson directly influences how I write content and choose structure for this site.
