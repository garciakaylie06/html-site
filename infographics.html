  <!-- Career Connection -->
  <section>
    <h2>How I Want to Use This With My Career</h2>
    <p>
      Creating infographics allows me to combine creativity with communication, which is a skill I want
      to highlight in my future career. These designs show my ability to present information clearly,
      think visually, and tailor content to an audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      I plan to use examples like these to demonstrate to employers that I can contribute creatively
      while still meeting professional and technical expectations in digital and media-focused roles.

  <h3>Why Infographics Matter to Me</h3>

  <p>
    I like infographics because they combine design, organization, and communication into one thing. A good infographic does more than just look nice; it also helps the reader understand the information in a way that makes sense and is easy to understand. 
  </p>

  <p>
    I think about organization and clarity when I make infographics. Also, about what someone should notice first and what can be made easier. This is similar to how semantic HTML works, where headings and sections help people understand content even before it is styled.
  </p>

  <p>
    Making infographics has also taught me how important it is to be aware of your audience and make things easy to understand because not everyone is going to look at it the same way. The design has failed if the information is hard to understand or too much to take in. That lesson has a direct impact on how I write and organize the content on this site.  </p>
