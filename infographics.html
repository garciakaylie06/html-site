    <h2>How I Want to Use This With My Career</h2>
    <p>
      Creating infographics allows me to combine creativity with communication, which is a skill I want
      to highlight in my future career. These designs show my ability to present information clearly,
      think visually, and tailor content to an audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      I plan to use examples like these to demonstrate to employers that I can contribute creatively
      while still meeting professional and technical expectations in digital and media-focused roles.
