  <h3>Why I Built This Site</h3>

  <p>
    Making this site has not only been for the purpose of school work, but it has taught me to slow down and focus on the basics of web development instead of rushing to make things look nice. In the past, I noticed that it was easy to think a page was "done" just because of the design or styling, even when the structure underneath wasn't very strong. These assignments made me think more carefully about how content is arranged and why each part is there.
  </p>

  <p>
    This site also shows how I really work. I like things to be clear, organized clearly, and to know exactly what is expected of me before I move on. Writing real content and using semantic HTML elements with it helped me understand how structure affects overall clarity, even before any styling is added.
  </p>

  <p>
    I avoided using placeholder text because I want this site to grow with my skills and felt that would do me no good. This project will help me keep track of my progress as I learn HTM. A strong base makes it easier for future changes to be expected and necessary.  </p>
