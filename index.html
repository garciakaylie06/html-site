  <h3>Why I Built This Site</h3>

  <p>
    I built this site as a way to slow down and focus on the fundamentals of web development instead of rushing to make things look polished. In past projects, I noticed that it was easy to rely on design or styling to make a page feel “done,” even when the structure underneath was not very strong. This assignment pushed me to think more intentionally about how content is organized and why each section exists.
  </p>

  <p>
    This site also reflects how I actually work. I am someone who likes clear steps, logical organization, and knowing exactly what is expected before moving forward. Writing real content and pairing it with semantic HTML elements helped me see how structure affects readability, accessibility, and overall clarity, even before any styling is added.
  </p>

  <p>
    I chose to be honest in my writing rather than using placeholder text because this site is meant to grow with me. As I continue learning more about HTML, accessibility, and eventually CSS and JavaScript, I want this site to serve as a reference point for how my skills develop over time. Starting with a strong foundation makes future improvements more meaningful instead of cosmetic.
